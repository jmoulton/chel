    What\ magic\ to\ even\ get\ the\ shot\ away
    Gaining\ space...maybe\ time.
    Drilled\ into\ the\ turnbuckle
    A\ lightening\ like\ glove
    Got\ that\ in\ the\ trapper!
    The\ draw,\ the\ tie-up,\ and\ his\ team\ prevails
    Two\ guys\ together\ with\ force...BIG\ force
    The\ stick\ can\ break\ up\ a\ play...and\ it\ just\ DID!
    Forcing\ attention\ in\ deep
    WAFFLEBOARDED!
    He\ got\ REEFED!
    A\ HAMMER\ SHOT!
    That\ shot\ HIT\ A\ MAN!
    What\ a\ RIPPER!
    Big\ sweeping\ save!
    Will\ this\ be\ icing?\ Aaaand\ it\ will\ be!\ on\ the\ defense\ arriving\ first
    oh\ heâ€™ll\ pay\ for\ that\ one!
    My\ goodness!
    No\ team\ worth\ its\ name\ will\ stand\ for\ this
