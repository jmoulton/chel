  What\ magic\ to\ even\ get\ the\ shot\ away
  Gaining\ space...maybe\ time.
  Drilled\ into\ the\ turnbuckle
  A\ lightening\ like\ glove
  Got\ that\ in\ the\ trapper!
  The\ draw,\ the\ tie-up,\ and\ his\ team\ prevails
  Two\ guys\ together\ with\ force...BIG\ force
  The\ stick\ can\ break\ up\ a\ play...and\ it\ just\ DID!
  Forcing\ attention\ in\ deep
  WAFFLEBOARDED!
  He\ got\ REEFED!
  A\ HAMMER\ SHOT!
  That\ shot\ HIT\ A\ MAN!
  What\ a\ RIPPER!
  Big\ sweeping\ save!
  Will\ this\ be\ icing?\ Aaaand\ it\ will\ be!\ on\ the\ defense\ arriving\ first
  oh\ heâ€™ll\ pay\ for\ that\ one!
  My\ goodness!
  No\ team\ worth\ its\ name\ will\ stand\ for\ this
  THAT\ WAS\ DEFENSE!!
  Moving\ to\ the\ shadow\ of\ the\ boards
  Gets\ in\ what'll\ he\ do?
  Two\ sticks\ together\ they\ cancel
  Big\ hit...possesion\ GONE!
  HIT\ THE\ POST\ WITH\ THE\ SHOT!!!
  What\ a\ skill\ level\ there!
  Goalie\ to\ the\ bench\ extra\ attacker\ out
  NET\ OPEN!
  Solid\ win\ at\ center\ ice,\ now\ what?
  He\ ran\ right\ over\ the\ goalie!
  One\ of\ the\ best\ parts\ about\ this\ game\ is\ two\ big\ men\ colliding
  Oh\ did\ ever\ get\ mashed!
  ...and\ it\ is\ played\ by\ the\ largest\ stick\ on\ the\ ice
  SHOOOOOTING!!!
  That's\ a\ good\ solid\ hit,\ he'll\ feel\ that\ one\
  The\ winds\ have\ shifted\ yet\ again
  Rubbed\ out\ along\ the\ boards
  Seemed\ impossible\ but\ they've\ done\ it!

  Oh\ that\ shot\ just\ hit\ his\ glove
  He\ stick\ handled\ himself\ into\ submission!
  I\ thought\ the\ second\ save\ was\ better
  You\ can't\ go\ around\ and\ hit\ everybody\ ESPECIALLY\ if\ they\ don't\ have\ the\ puck
  The\ goalie\ makes\ himself\ look\ big
  He\ may\ have\ seen\ him\ at\ the\ last\ minute\ to\ absorb\ that\ hit
  A\ missed\ opportunity\ from\ this\ close\ in
  he\ was\ looking\ to\ knock\ him\ into\ the\ third\ row!
